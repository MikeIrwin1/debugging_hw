Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
```
The purpose of a breakpoint is to pause the running code at the position of the breakpoint in order 
to step through and fix any issues.
```
2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
```
The line of code a breakpoint is on is not run when you start debugging.
```
3. How do we debug the next line of code?
```
You can step through the code using step into or step over buttons.
```
4. What does the step into command do?
```
Step into command takes you to the next line of code in the order that it is run.
Moving into methods if necessary.
```
5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
```
Evaluate expression lets you run a single line of java code on the current state of the program. 
Code fragment allows you to run multiple lines of java code on the current state of the program 
and also allows you to create temporary variables which persist while you have the code fragment 
window open.
```
